# CS 550 -- Fall Quarter 2021
## Final Project: Auto Motion
#### Professor Mike Bailey

## Project Description

This project, titled "Auto Motion", aims to create a realistic moving vehicle scenario. It includes a lit car with functional headlights that move in synchrony with the car.

## Project Proposal

The project consists of several key steps:

1. Downloading a car .obj file from the [Oregon State University engineering database](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/cs557/Obj/).
2. Applying lighting to the car.
3. Making the car move.
4. Programming the car's headlights to be lit and to move in sync with the car.

The main components involved in the project include:

1. A 3D car object, displayed by importing the .obj file.
2. Lighting effects for the car and its headlights.
3. Transformations and viewing to move the car and the headlights along with it.
